a,
This is a 2D game simulating the classic game Pokemon. In our version we will have a chatacter moving, with a Pokemon following him.

b,
As a player I can use the arrow keys on the keyborad to controll the chatacter, so that the chatacter can change the direction that he is facing to.

As a player I can use the arrow keys on the keyborad to controll the chatacter, so that the chatacter can move in either up, down, left, or right.

c,
The software can run. It opens up a new window and displays a pokemon map, in which there is a chatacter followed by a Pikachu. On the map there are some trees houses, and bushes. We can use the arrow keys to controll the character to make it move. The Pikachu will always follow the character.

d,
As a player, I can move the character to some different locations, so that the background music will change.
As a player, I can move the chatacter to the door of a house, so that the character will enter the house and the map will change.
As a player, I can enter a menu before entering the map, so that I can see some pre-dialoge, some pre-illustration, or just some pictures.
As a player, I can choose the character, so that the character we will be controlling will change to the one we select.
As a player, I can select the Pokemon, so that the Pokemon following the chracter will change to the one we select.
As a player, I can press some button on the keyboard, so that the character can "run" (move faster)
As a player, I can press some button on the keyboard, so that the character will be able to ride a bike and move faster.
As a player, I can press some key when facing the Pokemon, so that they will interact with each other.

d,
1, We can add some links to information about the "YELLOW VERSION" mentioned in the file, since not everyone has played that version, providing a link will help them understand what this version is. For example, we can add the Wikipedia link.
2, We can add explanations of some particularly important functions in each file. Since right now it only has big picture of each file does, but doesn't have any info about particular functions in them. In order the maintain the software, it is essential to understand how the function actuall works. So adding those info will be helpful.

e,
target "jar", target "download", need some comment.
target "jws" needs to be removed.

f,
There are enough issues to work on to gain 1000 points. The issues are pretty clear. And we may also add more issues if we came up with some.

g,
1, we can probably add some background music, which will change according to the place the chracter goes.

h,
The code is organized in ten .java files, and each of them correspond the different elements of the game. The purpose of the classed are pretty clear. However, some methods are not that clear, without more detailed comments. We may need to inspect the code one line by one line to try to figure out how it works. Since there are so many fils, it is not really clear how each class is related to others. The code was well organized, with some comment on it, so I would say it is time-consuming to understand the code, but it might not be too hard. If I have to help someone else to get up to speed quickly, I would tell him to start from the GameMain.java. Try first to understand in the main function, how rederer, gamelogic, mainwindow are related to other classes and how they work.

i,
I think there is Junit text, according to the build.xml. However, when we tried to do an test, it said fail to build. So we sill have to figure out how to use the test cases. What's more, we can also test by just run the program, since most feature we will add is about GUI effect, we can test by actually see how the graph is doing compared to our expectation
