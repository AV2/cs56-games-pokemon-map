(a) User controls a character to walk around the pokemon world and interact with the world.

(b) as a user I can move up, down, left, and right, for no real reason at all

(c) The software runs. The current map is a tiny square of green grass. The player-character can move but is not animated. The player-character can walk outside the bounds of the map, and begins to smear.

(d)*  We would like to walk around the pokemon world to actually explore
   *  We would like to be able to interact with the world, to learn more about it
   *  We would like to have a pokemon follow us around, so that we feel happy and more immersed in the world.
   *  We would like to travel between separate maps, to experience more of the world

(e) The readme is currently rather simple, with a short explanation of the file structure as well as an explanation of the current capabilities of the game and an explanation in how to extract sprites from bitmaps.
    What could be included:
    * An updated image of the game
    * A more in-depth explanation of how the files are structured/how everything interacts

(f) The current buildfile requires a good deal of cleanup and rewriting. Most targets lack a description, and there are multiple obsolete targets.

(g) There are plenty of issues for us to work on. Some are structural issues for the game engine, such as a memory leak or migrating the project to a full graphics framework, while others are more creative, such as adding in new/previously removed features. Most of the issues are rather clear as to the eventual goal, but most do not offer suggestions on where to begin. Additionally, some of the issues seem to be under-estimated for point value.

(h) We have not yet added any new issues.

(i) The code is very large, but well organized. It looks like "pretty" code, though the sheer breadth of the project is, at first, rather daunting. What code we do read is easy to understand in and of itself, but with such a large project distributed amongst so many files, it is a challenge to really understand how everything fits together.

(j) The project is currently lacking in test coverage. Currently, only the vectors and animations have any tests at all. Most of everything has no tests. There is *definitely* an opportunity to expand the test coverage. Expansion would require writing tests for every method in every file that is currently untested.
