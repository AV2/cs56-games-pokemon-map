###500pts of Issues for next lab:

1. Create a way to load a map from a file. We can currently read a map from a string, but there would be a significant advantage to loading from files, including hot swapping maps easily. [Issue #44](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/44) ~100pts
2. Get animation to run and run smoothly. We currently have animation tests set up, but animation is not currently set up [Issue #45](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/45) ~100pts
3. Add back in the Pikachu that follows the player. With the current move system, you may need to add in the last position of Professor Oak for Pikachu to move to. Look at the MoveCommand class (currently deprecated) to see a general framework for storing the last position of Oak and how you might get Pikachu to move to that position. [Issue #46](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/46) ~100pts
4. Handle collision properly. Currently collision isn't handled at all. It might be best to have the movement system to check the world tile that Oak is trying to move to and cancel that movement if its collidable. Tiles do hold data on whether they are collidable or not. Previously collision was handled in the rendering system which caused lots of issues for adding code, so try not to do that. [Issue #47](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/47) ~200pts
5. Movable camera. Usually the camera centers on the Player. We have a general framework for the camera in the RenderSystem, which is just a rectangle. You will need to figure out how to handle the camera without coupling the rendering with the logic too much. Maybe have the render system store a position component of the entity you want to track. You could also abstract out the camera into a separate class so it can handle movement and simply have the render system call the camera to update. [Issue #48](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/48) ~50pts
6. Have screen refresh properly to prevent smearing. [Issue #49](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/49) ~50pts
7. There is a memory leak in the game. Use a profiler to find it. [Issue #50](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pokemon-map/issues/50) ~150pts
