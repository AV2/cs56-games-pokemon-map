(a) Pokemon map is a 2D map where you control a player using WASD keys. It renders the map by using tiles of entities each with components that are hard-coded.

(b) As a user I can press W, A, S, or D so that the map will update and change the player's sprite.

(c) The software runs and the map generates successfully. The player can move properly, but some collision errors occur and the player can walk off the map entirely.

(d)*  We would like to implement a feature to allow the player to enter buildings and interact with the pond.
   *  We would like to fix the bug of smearing when the player walks off the map, as well as collision errors.
   *  We would like to implement a feature to have a Pokemon follow the player.
   *  We would like to implement a simple narrative text feature that updates as the player interacts with the map.

(e) The readme is short and to the point. It does not make an effort to explain the more complex aspects of the project's packages such as sprites, entities, components, and systems. 
   What could be changed:
    * Better explanation on how the map works on a fundamental basis.
    * Include a flowchart that describes how the game's packages integrate to update the map.
    * Update the example image

(f) Fortunately the pair programmers before us cleaned up the build.xml. All targets have descriptions.

(g) There are enough issues for us to earn 1000 points, although our mentor encouraged us to add new issues. The issues are clear in their expectations, however some are ambitious for their point value.

(h) We have not yet added any new issues.

(i) The purpose of most of the classes in the project repo is clear. One group of classes, Systems, is hard to understand conceptually, but most of the code is clear and understandable. The difficulty in this project is how all of these distributed classes interact with each other to generate the game. If I wanted to get another programmer up to speed, I would try to convey the complexity of how the elements of the project interact with each other, moreso than the individual parts. 

(j) The test coverage is slim to none. There are no solid unit tests for the project. This is evident in the errors we intend on debugging. To implement tests, we plan to work from the bottom up, starting with the 'building blocks' of the game before testing large scale behavior.
